This assignment was quite difficult not knowing where to start given no previous knowldge about python. We (Janna Gilleman & I) set up our classes organizing computer methods from resale shop methods, but decided that the data about the specific computer should be in the Computer class and nothing else. We wanted the resale shop to manage the inventory instead of having things done on individual machines. 

We had a lot of trouble getting our files for the Computer class and the Resale Shop class to talk to eachother since we both are unexperienced with python. We also were confused by the nested dictionaries in the procedural code, and reorganized to have it referencing the Computer class directly where the computers' information would be accessible  for the inventory. 

This assignment was quite difficult for us, and that's while accounting for my and Janna's experience in multiple other languages. We would have benefitted greatly from greater explicit examples of how to get classes to communicate and the functionalities of dictionaries with object oriented format, as well as with more description of how "self" works. We mor or less threw things together hoping they would stick.
